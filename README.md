## About 🤔:

For the final assignment of the Object-Oriented Programming course, the team chose to develop a project in the style of "Guitar Hero," where the player needs to press the keys at the right moment according to the notes of the music displayed on the screen. During the project implementation, it was possible to apply several concepts learned throughout the semester.

### Gameplay 🎮:

At first, you can choose one of five songs. After selecting the song, the user must choose the difficulty level of the gameplay: easy, medium, or hard.

During the gameplay, musical notes will be displayed on the screen as descending lines towards an area with arrow markings. When the notes reach these regions, the player must press the corresponding arrow keys on the keyboard. If they hit the exact moment, the player's score will increase. If they press at the wrong time or don't press at all, the score will be reduced.
